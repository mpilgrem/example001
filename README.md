A solution to an exercise in Haskell, namely:

"The UK's House of Common's Library publishes rich data about the results of the
UK's 2024 general election in the form of a CSV file
[here](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/6/candidacies.csv).

If people who had voted for Reform UK had all voted Conservative instead, what
would have been the result of the UK's 2024 general election?"

## Notes

The CSV file itself is not checked-in to the repository.
